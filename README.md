# Brain Tumor Detection

In developing an accurate and efficient brain tumor detection model, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed, with MRI images serving as the primary data source. The model architecture was centered around key components: Conv2D layers, Max Pooling layers, and Dropout layers, each contributing significantly to the network's learning and generalization capabilities.

Conv2D layers were crucial for extracting spatial features from the MRI images. By applying convolutional filters, the model captured essential patterns like edges, textures, and shapes that indicate tumor presence. These layers performed hierarchical feature extraction, starting with simple features in the initial layers and progressing to more complex structures in deeper layers.

Max Pooling layers were used to down-sample the feature maps generated by the Conv2D layers. This step reduced the computational load and helped the model focus on the most significant features by retaining critical information while discarding less important details. This process was vital for enhancing the model's efficiency and reducing the risk of overfitting.

To further prevent overfitting and improve the modelâ€™s robustness, Dropout layers were incorporated. During training, these layers randomly set a portion of the input units to zero, encouraging the network to learn redundant representations and improving its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Together, these components enabled the creation of a deep learning model capable of effectively analyzing MRI images to distinguish between healthy and tumor-affected brain scans, demonstrating CNNs' potential in medical image analysis and contributing to early diagnosis and treatment planning.
